Release v1.2.3 - Emergency fix for v1.2.2 packaging failures

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIXES:
- Fixed distribution missing .apm/agents directory (v1.2.2 was non-functional)
- Fixed undefined context variable in subagent_stop.py hook
- Added comprehensive build validation to prevent future packaging failures
- Enhanced build script with error handling and verification

ðŸ”§ IMPROVEMENTS:
- Build now validates all critical components are included
- Enhanced error reporting and build verification
- Added package validation checks for core files
- Better build output with agent file counts

ðŸŽ¯ DELIVERS:
- Enhanced logging features that were promised in v1.2.2
- Functional distribution package with complete AP system
- Real session analytics instead of \"unknown, 0 seconds, None\"
- Transcript parsing for meaningful hook logs

This emergency release fixes the packaging failures that made v1.2.2
completely non-functional and ensures users get the enhanced logging
features that were developed but never delivered.
