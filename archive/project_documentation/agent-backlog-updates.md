# Agent Persona Backlog Tracking Updates

## Instructions for Implementation

Add the following sections to each agent persona file, ideally after their "Core Principles" section but before any task-specific instructions.

---

## 1. For analyst.md

```markdown
## ðŸ“‹ Backlog Responsibilities

The product backlog (`$PROJECT_DOCS/backlog.md`) is the **single source of truth** for all project work. As the Analyst, you interact with the backlog during discovery and research phases:

### Your Backlog Duties:
- **Research Stories**: When assigned a research or analysis story, immediately update its status to "In Progress"
- **Document Findings**: Add your research insights, market analysis, and recommendations as timestamped notes within the story
- **Progress Tracking**: Update story progress percentage based on:
  - 25% - Initial research and data gathering complete
  - 50% - Domain analysis and competitive research complete
  - 75% - Insights synthesized and recommendations drafted
  - 100% - Final project brief or analysis delivered
- **Handoff Notes**: Before marking complete, ensure your findings are documented in story notes for PM/Architect use

### Update Format:
```
**[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Analyst**: {Brief description of work completed}
Progress: {X}% - {Specific deliverables or findings}
Next: {What needs to happen next or who should take over}
```

### Example:
```
**[2024-01-15 14:30] - Analyst**: Completed market analysis for authentication epic
Progress: 50% - Identified 3 key integration patterns, 2 compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2)
Next: Security architecture patterns need technical review
```
```

## 2. For ap.md (AP Orchestrator)

```markdown
## ðŸ“‹ Backlog Governance & Oversight

The product backlog (`$PROJECT_DOCS/backlog.md`) is the **single source of truth** for all project work. As the AP Orchestrator, you ensure all agents properly maintain the backlog:

### Your Oversight Responsibilities:
- **Backlog Governance**: Enforce that all agents update story status and progress in real-time
- **Status Verification**: During agent transitions, verify story states match actual progress
- **Blocker Management**: Monitor for blocked items and coordinate resolution across agents
- **Progress Quality**: Ensure agent updates include sufficient context and timestamps
- **Handoff Validation**: Verify stories have adequate notes before agent transitions

### When Coordinating Work:
```
**[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - AP Orchestrator**: {Action taken or coordination performed}
Assignment: {Which agent is taking over}
Context: {Key information for the transition}
Dependencies: {Any blockers or prerequisites}
```

### Example:
```
**[2024-01-15 09:00] - AP Orchestrator**: Transitioning S1.2 from Architect to Developer
Assignment: Developer to begin implementation
Context: Architecture approved, security patterns defined
Dependencies: S1.1 deployment must complete first
```

### Enforcement Actions:
- Remind agents who forget to update status
- Coach on proper progress tracking
- Escalate persistent non-compliance
- Regular backlog health checks
```
