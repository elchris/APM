# E-Commerce Platform API Architecture

## Architecture Decision: Microservices Approach

**Decision**: Adopt a microservices architecture with API Gateway pattern for the e-commerce platform.

**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: Different services (product catalog, user management, order processing) have different load patterns
- **Technology Diversity**: Payment processing might benefit from different tech stack than product catalog
- **Team Autonomy**: Multiple teams can work independently on different services
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service don't cascade to entire system
- **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed and updated independently

## Core Microservices

### 1. User Service
- User registration, authentication, profile management
- Account verification, password reset
- User preferences and settings

### 2. Product Service
- Product catalog management
- Inventory tracking
- Product search and filtering
- Product reviews and ratings

### 3. Cart Service
- Shopping cart operations
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Cart sharing and wishlist functionality

### 4. Order Service
- Order creation and management
- Order status tracking
- Order history

### 5. Payment Service
- Payment processing orchestration
- Payment method management
- Transaction history
- Refund processing

### 6. Inventory Service
- Stock level management
- Inventory reservations
- Supplier integrations
- Stock alerts

### 7. Notification Service
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Push notifications
- Notification preferences

### 8. Analytics Service
- User behavior tracking
- Sales analytics
- Performance metrics
- Reporting

## API Gateway Architecture

```
Internet → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Microservices
                                    ↓
                              Service Discovery
                              Rate Limiting
                              Authentication
                              Request Routing
                              Response Aggregation
```

### API Gateway Responsibilities
- **Routing**: Direct requests to appropriate microservices
- **Authentication**: Validate JWT tokens and OAuth flows
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement tier-based rate limiting
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across service instances
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Handle API versioning
- **Caching**: Cache frequently requested data
- **Monitoring**: Log requests and collect metrics

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- **REST APIs**: For real-time operations (user actions, cart updates)
- **GraphQL**: For complex data fetching (product details with reviews)

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Event Streaming**: Order events, inventory updates
- **Message Queues**: Email notifications, background processing
- **Event Sourcing**: Order state changes, audit trails

## Data Management Strategy

### Database per Service
- **User Service**: PostgreSQL (relational user data)
- **Product Service**: MongoDB (flexible product schemas)
- **Cart Service**: Redis (fast session storage)
- **Order Service**: PostgreSQL (transactional data)
- **Payment Service**: PostgreSQL (financial data integrity)
- **Inventory Service**: PostgreSQL (stock tracking)
- **Analytics Service**: ClickHouse (time-series data)

### Data Consistency Patterns
- **Saga Pattern**: For distributed transactions (order processing)
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and state reconstruction
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for performance

## Infrastructure Components

### Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- Service-to-service communication security
- Traffic management and load balancing
- Observability and monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns

### Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Service deployment and scaling
- Service discovery
- Health checks and self-healing
- Rolling updates

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **APM**: Application Performance Monitoring

## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Network
- All service-to-service communication encrypted
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal communication
- Network policies and segmentation

### Defense in Depth
- API Gateway security (rate limiting, DDoS protection)
- Service-level authentication and authorization
- Database access controls
- Secrets management (HashiCorp Vault)

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

### Multi-Region Deployment
- Active-active setup for high availability
- Cross-region data replication
- Automated failover mechanisms

### Backup and Recovery
- Automated database backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Disaster recovery testing procedures

## Development and Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing (unit, integration, contract)
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases

### API Governance
- API design standards
- Contract testing
- Breaking change detection
- API lifecycle management
