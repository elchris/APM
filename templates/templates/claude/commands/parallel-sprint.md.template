# Parallel Sprint Coordination

**Scrum Master Only**: Coordinates parallel development execution based on Product Owner's sprint plan by launching multiple developer agents simultaneously.

## Overview

The `/parallel-sprint` command enables the Scrum Master to orchestrate true parallel development by:
- Analyzing the Product Owner's sprint plan and story assignments
- Launching multiple Developer agents simultaneously on different stories
- Coordinating dependencies and cross-story integration points
- Monitoring progress across all parallel development streams
- Synthesizing results into cohesive sprint deliverables

## Usage

```
/parallel-sprint
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Product Owner has created a sprint plan with story assignments
- [ ] Stories are properly groomed with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies between stories are documented
- [ ] Backlog.md is current with story priorities and assignments ({{PROJECT_ROOT}}/{{BACKLOG_PATH}}/backlog.md)

## What This Command Does

### Phase 1: Sprint Plan Analysis (Tasks 1-3)
1. **Load Sprint Plan**: Parse the Product Owner's current sprint plan
2. **Analyze Story Dependencies**: Map inter-story dependencies and integration points  
3. **Developer Capacity Planning**: Determine optimal developer agent allocation

### Phase 2: Parallel Development Launch (Tasks 4-8)
4. **Launch Primary Developer Stream**: Start main feature development
5. **Launch Secondary Developer Stream**: Start parallel feature work
6. **Launch Integration Developer**: Handle cross-story integration points
7. **Launch Testing Coordination**: Coordinate testing across parallel streams
8. **Monitor Parallel Progress**: Track all development streams simultaneously

### Phase 3: Coordination & Synthesis (Tasks 9-12)
9. **Dependency Resolution**: Coordinate handoffs between development streams
10. **Integration Oversight**: Ensure parallel work integrates correctly
11. **Progress Synthesis**: Aggregate progress from all developer agents
12. **Sprint Health Assessment**: Evaluate overall sprint progress and risks

## Expected Outcomes

- **Parallel Development Streams**: 2-4 Developer agents working simultaneously
- **Coordinated Integration**: Seamless merging of parallel development work
- **Accelerated Delivery**: 60-80% reduction in sequential development time
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification and resolution of integration issues
- **Sprint Visibility**: Real-time progress tracking across all development streams

## Parallel Development Benefits

- **Velocity Multiplication**: Multiple stories developed concurrently
- **Reduced Cycle Time**: Stories complete in parallel rather than sequence
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Optimal developer agent allocation
- **Risk Distribution**: Parallel streams reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- **Integration Excellence**: Proactive coordination prevents merge conflicts

## Integration Points

- **Product Owner**: Consumes sprint plans and story prioritization
- **Developer Agents**: Launches multiple simultaneous development streams
- **QA Agent**: Coordinates testing across parallel development work
- **Architecture**: Ensures parallel work maintains system consistency

## Success Metrics

- **Stories Completed in Parallel**: Target 2-4 simultaneous development streams
- **Integration Success Rate**: > 95% successful merges between parallel work
- **Sprint Velocity**: 60-80% improvement over sequential development
- **Dependency Resolution Time**: < 4 hours average resolution
- **Team Coordination Score**: Seamless handoffs between parallel streams

## Command Implementation

When you run `/parallel-sprint`, I will:

1. **Execute Sprint Analysis**: Run 3 parallel analysis tasks to understand the sprint plan
2. **Coordinate Developer Launch**: Launch 2-4 Developer agents on different stories simultaneously  
3. **Monitor Integration**: Track cross-story dependencies and integration points
4. **Synthesize Progress**: Aggregate results from all parallel development streams
5. **Report Sprint Status**: Provide comprehensive sprint health and progress assessment

This command transforms the Scrum Master into a parallel development orchestrator, enabling true concurrent story development based on the Product Owner's strategic planning.
