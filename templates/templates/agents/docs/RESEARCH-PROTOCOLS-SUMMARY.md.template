# 🔴 CRITICAL: RESEARCH PROTOCOLS (Agent Quick Reference)

## 🚨 GOLDEN RULE: NEVER GUESS, ALWAYS VERIFY

### 📋 MANDATORY SEQUENCE BEFORE ANY DECISION:

1. **🔍 SEARCH PROJECT DOCS**: Check {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/ and {{SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}/
2. **🔍 SEARCH CODEBASE**: Use Grep/Glob to find existing implementations
3. **🔍 READ LOGS/CONFIGS**: Examine actual files and configurations
4. **🌐 RESEARCH EXTERNALLY**: Use WebSearch for authoritative sources
5. **❓ ASK USER**: Stop and ask specific questions when uncertain

### ❌ FORBIDDEN PHRASES (Indicate Hallucination):
- "I assume..." → ✅ "Let me search for..."
- "Probably..." → ✅ "I need to verify..."
- "It should be..." → ✅ "The documentation shows..."
- "Typically..." → ✅ "Based on the existing code..."

### ✅ REQUIRED EVIDENCE STATEMENTS:
- "According to [specific file/source]..."
- "The existing code in [path] shows..."
- "Based on my search of [location], I found..."
- "I need clarification on [specific aspect] because [context]"

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- Conflicting information found
- Missing critical documentation
- Ambiguous requirements
- Security/data integrity implications

**REMEMBER**: Better to ask one question than make ten wrong assumptions.
