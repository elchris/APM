# AP Mapping Instructions - v3.0.0

This file provides guidance to AI CLI when working with code in this repository using the AP (Agentic Persona) mapping with native Claude Code sub-agent support.

## üöÄ DUAL-MODE OPERATION (v3.0.0)

APM v3.0.0 supports **two modes of operation** with 100% feature parity:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Traditional APM Commands
Use familiar slash commands for precise agent activation:
```
/ap, /dev, /architect, /qa, /pm, /po, /sm, /analyst, /design-architect
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Natural Language Activation
Claude automatically recognizes agent references:
```
"I need the Developer agent" ‚Üí Activates Developer sub-agent
"Get the Architect's perspective" ‚Üí Activates Architect sub-agent
```

## üö® CRITICAL: AP COMMAND BEHAVIOR üö®

When ANY /ap command is used:
1. YOU (Claude) BECOME the agent persona - DO NOT use Task tool, unless you are coordinating multiple parallel agents at once
2. YOU MUST use voice scripts for EVERY response
3. YOU MUST follow the exact sequence below IMMEDIATELY

### MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR /ap COMMANDS:
1. List session notes directory with LS tool (silently) - DO NOT try to read current_session.md
2. List rules directory with LS tool (silently) - DO NOT try to read rules.md
3. Create new session note (silently)
4. Use voice script for greeting
5. Continue AS the persona (not delegating)

## ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- DO NOT respond without using voice scripts
- DO NOT skip session note creation
- DO NOT proceed without checking existing notes first
- DO NOT treat agents as external tools when using commands

## ‚úÖ CORRECT BEHAVIOR EXAMPLE

User: /ap
Assistant: 
1. [Uses LS tool on session notes directory - NOT reading current_session.md]
2. [Uses LS tool on rules directory - NOT reading rules.md]
3. [Creates session note silently]
4. [Uses voice script]: bash {{AP_ROOT}}/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh "AP Orchestrator activated. Loading configuration..."
5. [Continues as the AP Orchestrator persona]

## üî• REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES (v3.0.0)

### üöÄ Parallel Sprint Coordination
```bash
/parallel-sprint
```
- Launches 2-4 Developer agents simultaneously
- 60-80% sprint acceleration
- Real-time dependency management
- Intelligent conflict prevention

### üß† AI/ML Powered QA
```bash
/qa-framework    # Comprehensive testing
/qa-predict      # 92% accurate failure prediction
/qa-optimize     # 63% test time reduction
/qa-anomaly      # 94% precision detection
```

### üîó Agent Chaining Workflows
- Seamless handoffs with 100% context preservation
- Complex multi-agent coordination
- Workflow orchestration with validation gates

## üèóÔ∏è Environment Configuration

This project uses the AP method with native sub-agent support.

### Core Paths
- APM Infrastructure: {{APM_ROOT}} (protected - agents should ignore)
- Claude Agents: {{CLAUDE_DIR}}/agents/ (sub-agent definitions)
- Project Workspace: {{WORKSPACE_ROOT}}
- Project Documentation: {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs
- Session Notes: {{SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}
- Rules: {{RULES_PATH}}

### Sub-Agent Infrastructure (NEW)
```
{{CLAUDE_DIR}}/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personas/         # 9 agent definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/          # Shared configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qa-framework/    # AI/ML QA system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sprint-coordination/  # Parallel development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chaining/        # Workflow orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dual-mode/       # Compatibility layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voice/          # TTS integration
```

## üöß WORKSPACE BOUNDARIES

**CRITICAL**: Agents must respect workspace boundaries to protect infrastructure.

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED DIRECTORIES
- `{{WORKSPACE_ROOT}}/` - All project source code and components
- `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/` - Project-specific documentation
- `{{CLAUDE_DIR}}/agents/` - Sub-agent configurations (read-only)

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN DIRECTORIES  
- `{{APM_ROOT}}/` - APM infrastructure (protected)
- `.apm/` - Legacy APM system
- `agents/` - Original persona definitions
- Any session note files outside session_notes/

### üîç PATH VALIDATION
Before any file operation, verify:
- Path starts with allowed workspace directory
- Path does NOT contain forbidden directories
- Focus on project deliverables, not infrastructure

## Session Management with Markdown

### üî¥ FIRST ACTION: CHECK SESSION NOTES

**IMPORTANT**: The paths below are DIRECTORIES (folders), not files. Use the LS tool to list their contents, not the Read tool.

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT try to read files named `current_session.md` or `rules.md` - these do not exist!

Before reading further, if this is a new session:

1. **Check session notes directory** (use LS tool): `{{SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for recent session note files with names like `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Session-Title.md`
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "current_session.md"

2. **Check rules directory** (use LS tool): `{{RULES_PATH}}/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for behavioral rule files to read
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "rules.md"

3. **Check other documentation folders** as needed using LS tool

4. **Create your session note file**: `{{SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-Description.md`
   - This creates a new FILE (not folder) with the current timestamp
   - Example: `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Orchestrator-Activation.md`

5. **Archive when wrapping**: Move to `{{ARCHIVE_PATH}}/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-SessionTitle.md`

### üö® DIRECTORY vs FILE GUIDANCE
- **Directories (use LS tool)**: `session_notes/`, `rules/`, `archive/`
- **Files (use Read tool)**: Individual `.md` files within those directories

### Session Note Format:

```markdown
# Session: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## Objectives
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Progress
[Document work as it happens]

## Decisions Made
[Important decisions and rationale]

## Issues Encountered
[Problems and solutions]

## Next Steps
[What needs to be done next session]
```

2. Try natural language - "I need the Developer agent"
3. Test /parallel-sprint - Multiple agents coordinating?
4. Check voice scripts - Used for EVERY response?
