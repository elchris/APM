# Document Location Enforcer - Missing Patterns Fix
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Issue**: Product Brief created in root folder instead of proper location  
**Root Cause**: Missing document patterns in registry

---

## üîç Problem Analysis

### What Happened
When the Analyst agent created a product brief, it was placed in the root folder instead of being automatically relocated to the proper directory by the Document Location Enforcer.

### Why It Wasn't Caught
The Document Location Enforcer (`pre_tool_use_location_enforcer.py`) was working correctly, BUT the document registry configuration was missing patterns for:
1. **Product Briefs**
2. **PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)**  
3. **Project Briefs**

These are common outputs from Analyst and PM agents, but weren't configured in the system.

## üìã Registry Analysis

### Documents That WERE Configured
The document registry had patterns for:
- ‚úÖ Backlog
- ‚úÖ Stories  
- ‚úÖ Epics
- ‚úÖ Test Plans & Results
- ‚úÖ Architecture Decisions
- ‚úÖ Specifications
- ‚úÖ Reports
- ‚úÖ Session Notes
- ‚úÖ Defects
- ‚úÖ Meeting Notes
- ‚úÖ Retrospectives
- ‚úÖ Roadmaps
- ‚úÖ API Documentation
- ‚úÖ Deployment Guides

### Documents That Were MISSING
- ‚ùå Product Briefs
- ‚ùå PRDs
- ‚ùå Project Briefs

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### Added Two New Document Types

#### 1. Product Brief Pattern
```json
"product_brief": {
  "location": "{{PROJECT_DOCS}}/requirements/",
  "type": "collection",
  "naming": {
    "pattern": "{title}-product-brief.md",
    "title_format": "kebab-case"
  },
  "detection": {
    "filename_patterns": ["brief", "product-brief", "project-brief"],
    "content_markers": ["Product Brief", "Project Brief", "Product Vision", 
                        "Problem Statement", "Target Audience", "Objectives"],
    "agent_hints": ["Analyst", "PM", "Product Manager"]
  }
}
```

#### 2. PRD Pattern
```json
"prd": {
  "location": "{{PROJECT_DOCS}}/requirements/",
  "type": "collection",
  "naming": {
    "pattern": "{title}-PRD.md",
    "title_format": "kebab-case"
  },
  "detection": {
    "filename_patterns": ["prd", "PRD", "product-requirements"],
    "content_markers": ["Product Requirements", "PRD", "User Stories", 
                        "Acceptance Criteria", "Success Metrics"],
    "agent_hints": ["PM", "Product Manager", "PO", "Product Owner"]
  }
}
```

## üéØ Impact

### Before Fix
- Product briefs ‚Üí Root folder (incorrect)
- PRDs ‚Üí Root folder or random locations
- No automatic organization for requirements documents

### After Fix
- Product briefs ‚Üí `project_docs/requirements/` (correct)
- PRDs ‚Üí `project_docs/requirements/` (correct)
- Automatic naming: `{title}-product-brief.md` or `{title}-PRD.md`

---

## üîß How It Works Now

When an Analyst or PM creates a document:

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Checks filename for patterns like "brief", "prd", "product-requirements"
   - Scans content for markers like "Product Vision", "Requirements", etc.
   - Considers agent hints (Analyst ‚Üí likely a brief, PM ‚Üí likely a PRD)

2. **Relocation Phase**
   - Automatically moves to `project_docs/requirements/`
   - Renames file according to pattern
   - Preserves content while fixing location

3. **User Feedback**
   - Shows: `‚úÖ Created at correct location: project_docs/requirements/task-management-product-brief.md`
   - Transparent correction without blocking workflow

## üöÄ Testing the Fix

After installation, test with:

```python
# Analyst creates a product brief
Write(
    file_path="my-brief.md",
    content="# Product Brief\n\n## Product Vision\n..."
)
# Should automatically relocate to: project_docs/requirements/my-brief-product-brief.md

# PM creates a PRD
Write(
    file_path="requirements.md", 
    content="# Product Requirements Document\n\n## User Stories\n..."
)
# Should automatically relocate to: project_docs/requirements/requirements-PRD.md
```

## üìù Recommendations

### Additional Patterns to Consider
Future additions might include:
- Technical documentation
- User guides
- Release notes
- Change logs
- Security reports
- Performance reports

### Monitoring
Watch for documents still landing in root to identify other missing patterns.

*Document Location Enforcer now properly handles Product Briefs and PRDs*
*No more documents in the root folder from Analyst or PM agents*
