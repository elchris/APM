# Document Compliance Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The PM agent created documents with completely wrong naming conventions (e.g., `interactive-engagement-platform-business-case.md` instead of `EPIC-006-{title}.md`), and the Document Location Enforcer wasn't catching these violations even though it was running.

## Root Causes
1. **Agent templates didn't include document standards** - Agents had no instructions about proper naming conventions
2. **Document Location Enforcer only detected by filename** - If filename didn't contain "epic", it wouldn't be detected as an epic
3. **Orchestrator wasn't enforcing compliance** - No validation of agent work for document standards

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Agent Templates
Added mandatory document naming standards to:
- **PM Agent**: Explicit rules for epics, stories, reports, and PRDs
- **PO Agent**: Primary responsibility for epic/story creation with strict patterns
- **Orchestrator**: Document compliance enforcement as core responsibility

### 2. Smarter Document Location Enforcer
Enhanced detection with content-first approach:
- **Content Analysis**: Checks for epic/story markers in content (e.g., "Epic Owner:", "User Story:")
- **Forced Detection**: Even if filename is wrong, content markers force correct classification
- **Higher Content Weight**: 50% weight on content vs 30% on filename

### 3. Comprehensive Compliance Rules
Created `DOCUMENT_COMPLIANCE_RULES.md`:
- Clear patterns for all document types
- Examples of violations
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Agent-specific responsibilities

## Key Changes

### Agent Template Updates
```markdown
## üìù MANDATORY DOCUMENT NAMING STANDARDS

### Epic Documents
- **Pattern**: `EPIC-{id}-{title}.md` (e.g., `EPIC-001-payment-system.md`)
- **Location**: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/planning/epics/`
- **NEVER**: Use lowercase or skip the ID
```

### Document Enforcer Enhancement
```python
# PRIORITY 1: Check for explicit type markers in content
if any(marker in content for marker in [
    '# Epic:', 'Epic Owner:', 'Business Value:', 'Child Stories:'
]):
    return 'epic', 95.0  # Force epic detection
```

### Orchestrator Enforcement
```markdown
## üìù DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT
- **VERIFY** all agent-created documents follow naming patterns
- **REJECT** non-compliant work and require correction
- **MONITOR** document registry compliance across all agents
```

## Distribution Status
‚úÖ **APM v4.0.0 distribution built** with all fixes included:
- Enhanced agent templates with document standards
- Smarter Document Location Enforcer with content detection
- Orchestrator validation for compliance
- Comprehensive compliance rules documentation

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Agents will follow standards** - Templates now include explicit naming rules
2. **Enforcer catches violations** - Content-based detection ensures proper classification
3. **Orchestrator validates** - Non-compliant work gets rejected
4. **Automatic correction** - Wrong names/locations fixed automatically

## Testing Recommendation
After deploying this distribution:
1. Activate PM agent and request epic creation
2. Verify epic follows `EPIC-XXX-{title}.md` pattern
3. Check Document Location Enforcer logs for corrections
4. Confirm orchestrator rejects non-compliant documents
