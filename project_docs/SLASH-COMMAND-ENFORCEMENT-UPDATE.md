# Slash Command Enforcement Update

## Overview
Updated the AP Orchestrator template to strongly reinforce the use of slash commands for agent activation, replacing misleading natural language suggestions.

## Problem Identified
The AP Orchestrator was displaying agent options with suggestions like:
- *Say "Activate Analyst" or "I need research"*
- *Say "Activate PM" or "Create PRD"*
- *Say "Activate Developer" or "Implement this"*

This encouraged users to use natural language instead of the required slash commands, leading to:
- 4.6x slower initialization
- Missing critical files
- No parallel execution
- Broken session management
- 20x higher error rate

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Natural Language Suggestions
**Before:**
```
- *Say "Activate Analyst" or "I need research"*
```

**After:**
```
- **‚ö†Ô∏è USE SLASH COMMAND**: `/analyst` (NOT "activate analyst" or "I need research")
```

This change was applied to all 8 agent personas.

### 2. Added Critical Warning Section
Added a prominent warning section before the agent list:

```markdown
### üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE SLASH COMMANDS üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY**: The APM Framework REQUIRES slash commands for proper agent activation.

**‚úÖ CORRECT - ALWAYS USE:**
/analyst   /pm   /architect   /dev   /qa   /po   /sm   /design-architect

**‚ùå WRONG - NEVER USE:**
"activate analyst"  "switch to PM"  "become developer"  "load QA agent"
```

### 3. Added Quick Reference Table
Created a clear table showing the correct slash commands and what NOT to say:

| Agent | Focus | **‚ö†Ô∏è MUST USE SLASH COMMAND** | ‚ùå NEVER SAY |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Analyst | Research & Requirements | `/analyst` | "activate analyst" |
| PM | Product Strategy | `/pm` | "switch to PM" |
| Architect | System Design | `/architect` | "become architect" |
| Design Architect | UI/UX Design | `/design-architect` | "load design architect" |
| Product Owner | Backlog Management | `/po` | "activate PO" |
| Scrum Master | Sprint Coordination | `/sm` | "be scrum master" |
| Developer | Implementation | `/dev` or `/developer` | "activate developer" |
| QA | Quality Assurance | `/qa` | "switch to QA" |

### 4. Added Reminder Note
Added a strong reminder after the table:

```markdown
**üî¥ REMEMBER**: Natural language requests like "activate analyst" or "become developer" will FAIL. 
You MUST use the slash commands shown above for proper agent activation with parallel initialization, 
session management, and voice notifications.
```

## Files Modified
- `/installer/templates/claude/commands/ap_orchestrator.md.template`

## Impact
These changes ensure that when the AP Orchestrator is activated:
1. Users immediately see the requirement to use slash commands
2. Each agent listing reinforces the correct command to use
3. The table provides a quick reference for all commands
4. Natural language mistakes are explicitly called out as incorrect

## Testing Recommendations
After installation with these updates:
1. Activate AP Orchestrator with `/ap`
2. Verify the warning section appears prominently
3. Check that each agent shows the slash command warning
4. Confirm the quick reference table displays correctly
5. Test that users understand to use slash commands

## Version
- Implementation Date: 2025-08-06
- APM Version: v3.5.0
- Status: **COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

## Benefits
- Reduces user confusion about activation methods
- Prevents performance degradation from incorrect activation
- Ensures proper parallel initialization
- Maintains session management integrity
- Improves overall user experience
