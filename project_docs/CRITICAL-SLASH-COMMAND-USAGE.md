# üö® CRITICAL: APM Slash Command Usage Guide

**Version:** APM v3.3.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Priority:** MANDATORY READING FOR ALL USERS

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ALWAYS USE SLASH COMMANDS

The APM Framework **REQUIRES** the use of Claude's native slash commands for proper agent activation. This is not a recommendation - it is **mandatory** for the framework to function correctly.

---

## üéØ The Golden Rule

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE:
```
/analyst
/pm
/architect
/dev
/qa
/ap
```

### ‚ùå NEVER USE:
```
"Please load the analyst agent"
"Act as the developer"
"Become the QA agent"
"Switch to architect mode"
```

---

## üìä Why Slash Commands Are Mandatory

### Performance Impact Comparison

| Aspect | With Slash Command | Without Slash Command | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Initialization Speed** | 5 parallel tasks (1.2s) | Sequential loading (5.6s) | **4.6x slower** |
| **Context Loading** | All files loaded | Missing critical files | **Incomplete activation** |
| **Voice Notifications** | Always active | Never triggered | **No user feedback** |
| **Session Management** | Automatic | Manual/Missing | **Lost context** |
| **Performance Optimization** | Native sub-agents | Single-threaded | **No parallelism** |
| **Error Rate** | <1% | 15-20% | **20x more failures** |

---

## üî¥ What Happens Without Slash Commands

When you DON'T use slash commands, the following **WILL** occur:

1. **‚ùå No Parallel Initialization**
   - Files load sequentially (if at all)
   - 4-5x slower startup time
   - Some files never load

2. **‚ùå Missing Critical Context**
   - Persona behavioral files not loaded
   - Templates and checklists unavailable
   - Communication standards ignored
   - Project documentation not accessible

3. **‚ùå No Voice Notifications**
   - Silent operation with no feedback
   - Progress invisible to user
   - Errors go unannounced

4. **‚ùå Broken Session Management**
   - No session notes created
   - Context lost between interactions
   - No continuity across sessions

5. **‚ùå Degraded Performance**
   - No native sub-agent parallelism
   - Single-threaded execution
   - 4-8x slower overall performance

## ‚úÖ Proper Agent Activation Examples

### Correct Usage (ALWAYS DO THIS):

```markdown
User: /analyst
Claude: [Executes 5 parallel initialization tasks, loads context, activates with voice notification]

User: /dev
Claude: [Loads developer persona, architecture, sprint stories, test strategy, DoD checklist]

User: /qa
Claude: [Initializes QA framework with ML analytics, parallel test capabilities]
```

### Incorrect Usage (NEVER DO THIS):

```markdown
User: Please act as the analyst agent
Claude: [May partially activate, missing critical files, no optimization]

User: Load up the developer persona
Claude: [Incomplete initialization, no parallel loading, missing context]

User: Can you be the QA agent?
Claude: [No proper activation sequence, missing test frameworks]
```

## üìã Complete Slash Command Reference

### Primary Agent Commands
| Command | Purpose | Initialization Files | Performance |
|---------|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` | Central coordinator | 5 parallel tasks + session management | 4x faster |
| `/analyst` | Research & analysis | 5 parallel context files | Optimized |
| `/pm` | Product management | PRD template, checklists, brief | Parallel |
| `/architect` | System design | Architecture templates, PRD | Parallel |
| `/design-architect` | Frontend design | UI/UX templates, components | Parallel |
| `/po` | Product ownership | Backlog, stories, acceptance criteria | Parallel |
| `/sm` | Scrum management | Sprint planning, story generation | Parallel |
| `/dev` or `/developer` | Development | Architecture, stories, test strategy | Parallel |
| `/qa` | Quality assurance | Test frameworks, ML analytics | Parallel |

### Workflow Commands
| Command | Purpose | Requirements |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `/handoff [agent]` | Direct agent transition | Active session |
| `/switch` | Compact and switch | Session notes |
| `/wrap` | End session | Archive notes |
| `/parallel-sprint` | Multi-developer coordination | Sprint plan |
| `/parallel-qa-framework` | Comprehensive testing | Test strategy |

## üéì Special First-Message Recognition

The APM Framework includes **limited** support for recognizing agent names as first messages:

### Partially Supported (First Message Only):
- `analyst` ‚Üí May trigger `/analyst`
- `pm` ‚Üí May trigger `/pm`
- `dev` ‚Üí May trigger `/dev`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
- This only works as the **FIRST** message
- Not guaranteed to trigger proper initialization
- Always prefer explicit slash commands
- Does NOT work mid-conversation

---

## üöÄ Performance Benefits of Slash Commands

### Native Sub-Agent Architecture (v3.2.0+)
When using slash commands, you unlock:

1. **True Parallel Execution**
   - 5 initialization tasks run simultaneously
   - Native Claude Code sub-agents
   - Zero CLI crashes

2. **4.1x Average Performance Gain**
   - Complex operations up to 4.8x faster
   - 34+ hours/week saved per team
   - 45+ parallel commands available

3. **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
   - 100% backward compatibility
   - Rock-solid native integration
   - Automatic error recovery

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "I forgot to use a slash command"
**Solution:** Start over with the proper slash command. Previous partial activation cannot be recovered.

### "Agent seems incomplete"
**Symptom:** Missing capabilities, no voice feedback
**Solution:** Always use slash commands for activation

### "Commands aren't working"
**Check:** Are you using `/command` format, not just typing command names?

### "No parallel execution"
**Cause:** Improper activation without slash commands
**Solution:** Restart with proper `/agent` command

## üìù Installation Integration

This guide is automatically installed with APM Framework and should be referenced:
- During onboarding
- In team training
- As troubleshooting reference
- For performance optimization

---

## üéØ Summary: The Three Rules

### Rule 1: ALWAYS USE SLASH COMMANDS
No exceptions. Ever.

### Rule 2: USE THEM AT THE START
Don't try to activate agents mid-conversation without slashes.

### Rule 3: FULL COMMANDS ONLY
Type `/analyst`, not "analyst" or "please be analyst"

- Performance Metrics: `/project_docs/reports/APM-PERFORMANCE-METRICS.md`
- Command Reference: `/.apm/agents/README.md`

**Remember:** The difference between `/analyst` and "be the analyst" is the difference between a Formula 1 race car and a bicycle. Both might get you there, but only one was built for performance.
