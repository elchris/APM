## Business Objective

Establish the fundamental infrastructure and core capabilities required for the Claude.md Merge System, providing the foundation for safe, reliable, and efficient merge operations. This epic delivers the essential building blocks that enable all subsequent merge functionality while ensuring zero data loss through robust backup and validation systems.

- Standard vs customizable area documentation

### Section Parsing Framework
- Header-based section detection and extraction
- Section metadata generation (name, content, hash)
- Support for nested sections and complex formatting
- Structured data output for processing

### Backup Management System
- Timestamped backup creation before any operations
- Configurable backup retention policies
- Backup integrity validation and verification
- Complete restore functionality with rollback support

- **Testing**: Custom bash testing framework
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and README files

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Bash shell environment (v4.0 or higher)
- Standard Unix utilities (awk, sed, grep, md5sum)
- File system write permissions for backup operations
- Access to CLAUDE.md.markdown.template file

### Business Dependencies
- Approval of backup retention policies
- Confirmation of supported file formats
- Validation of cross-platform requirements
- Agreement on logging and error handling standards

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing on all target platforms and compatibility abstraction layer

### Backup System Reliability
**Risk**: Backup creation or restoration failures  
**Mitigation**: Multiple validation checks, atomic operations, and comprehensive error handling

### Performance on Large Files

- Standard Unix utilities are available on all target platforms
- File system supports atomic operations for backup safety

### Out of Scope
- GUI interface for backup management
- Cloud-based backup storage
- Advanced compression algorithms
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

### Future Considerations
- Plugin system for custom parsers
- Advanced backup strategies (incremental, differential)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Integration with version control systems
