## 🔧 Proposed APM Integration Architecture

### Directory Structure

├── agents/
│   └── qa/
│       ├── framework/           # QA Framework integration
│       │   ├── adapters/       # APM-to-Framework adapters

│       └── sessions/           # QA session management
└── config/
    └── qa-framework.json       # Framework configuration
```

### New QA Agent Commands
1. **`/qa test-gen <story-id>`** - Generate tests from story requirements
2. **`/qa test-run <suite>`** - Execute test suite with parallel processing
3. **`/qa security-scan`** - Run SAST/DAST security analysis
4. **`/qa performance-test`** - Execute performance test scenarios
5. **`/qa analytics`** - View ML-driven test insights
6. **`/qa coverage-report`** - Generate comprehensive coverage analysis

### Integration Points

#### 1. Story-to-Test Pipeline
```
User Story → QA Agent → Framework Adapter → Test Generation → Execution → Results
```

#### 2. Session Context Bridge
- QA Agent maintains APM session format
- Framework adapter translates to/from framework format
- Preserves context across handoffs

#### 3. Reporting Integration
- Framework generates detailed reports
- QA Agent summarizes for APM context
- Results stored in both systems

## 🎯 Critical Integration Considerations

### 1. Command Namespace
- All framework commands prefixed with `/qa`
- Prevents collision with existing APM commands
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Data Flow
```
APM Session → Adapter Layer → QA Framework
     ↑              ↓              ↓
     └──── Results Translation ←───┘
```

### 3. Configuration Management
- Framework config in `.apm/config/qa-framework.json`
- Agent-specific settings in `.apm/agents/qa/config.json`
- Environment variables for sensitive data

### 4. Error Handling
- Framework errors wrapped in APM-friendly format
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- Clear error messages for user guidance

## 🔍 Key Technical Details

### Framework API Endpoints
- **Test Generation**: `POST /api/tests/generate`
- **Test Execution**: `POST /api/tests/execute`
- **Results Query**: `GET /api/results/{executionId}`
- **Analytics**: `GET /api/analytics/insights`

### Adapter Pattern Implementation
```python
class QAFrameworkAdapter:
    def __init__(self, apm_context):
        self.context = apm_context
        self.framework = QAFramework()
    
    def translate_story_to_test(self, story):
        # Convert APM story format to framework format
        return self.framework.generate_tests(story)
    
    def execute_with_context(self, tests):
        # Preserve APM session during execution
        results = self.framework.execute(tests)
        return self.format_for_apm(results)
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Execution**: Framework supports up to 100 parallel test threads
2. **Resource Management**: Automatic scaling based on system resources
3. **Caching**: Test results cached for 24 hours
4. **Optimization**: ML model suggests optimal test execution order

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens
2. **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for sensitive test data
3. **Audit Logging**: All framework actions logged
4. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions aligned with APM

## 🚦 Migration Strategy
