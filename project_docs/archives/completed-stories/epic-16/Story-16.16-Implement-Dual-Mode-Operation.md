# Story 16.16: Implement Dual-Mode Operation

**Epic**: EPIC-016 (APM to Sub-Agents Migration)  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Sprint**: 17  

## Story Statement

As a user,  
I want dual-mode operation that supports both APM commands and sub-agents,  
so that I can gradually transition to the new system while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Dual-mode operation system implemented
2. [ ] Both APM commands (`.apm/` based) and sub-agents functional
3. [ ] Seamless switching between modes available
4. [ ] User preference settings for default mode
5. [ ] Migration guidance and recommendations provided
6. [ ] Performance comparison tools available
7. [ ] Graceful deprecation path for APM system established

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Design dual-mode architecture
  - [ ] Create mode detection and routing logic
  - [ ] Design preference management system
  - [ ] Plan seamless switching mechanisms
  
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility layer
  - [ ] Preserve all existing APM commands
  - [ ] Maintain APM session management
  - [ ] Ensure APM voice notifications continue working
  
- [ ] Create migration assistance tools
  - [ ] Build mode comparison utilities
  - [ ] Create migration recommendations
  - [ ] Implement performance tracking for both modes
  
- [ ] Test dual-mode functionality
  - [ ] Verify both modes work independently
  - [ ] Test seamless switching between modes
  - [ ] Validate preference settings work
  - [ ] Confirm migration tools functional

## Dev Technical Guidance

```yaml
# Dual-Mode Implementation:

# Mode Detection:
- User preference settings in .claude/settings.json
- Command-based mode switching
- Default mode configuration

# Backward Compatibility:
- Preserve all APM infrastructure in .apm/
- Maintain existing command patterns
- Keep voice script integration

# Migration Path:
- Gradual agent-by-agent migration
- Performance comparison tracking
- User education and guidance

# Deprecation Strategy:
- Clear timeline for APM phase-out
- User notification system
- Migration assistance tools
```
