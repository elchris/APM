# Story 16.13: Preserve AI/ML QA Capabilities

**Epic**: EPIC-016 (APM to Sub-Agents Migration)  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: 16  

## Story Statement

As a QA professional,  
I want all AI/ML-powered QA capabilities preserved in the sub-agent system,  
so that I maintain advanced testing features with 92% prediction accuracy and 4x performance improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] AI/ML test failure prediction preserved (92% accuracy maintained)
2. [ ] Test execution optimization functional (63% time reduction)
3. [ ] Quality anomaly detection operational (94% precision)
4. [ ] Parallel test execution capabilities maintained (4x speedup)
5. [ ] Security scanning (SAST/DAST) features intact
6. [ ] Performance and load testing capabilities preserved
7. [ ] AI-powered quality insights and analytics functional
8. [ ] All QA framework commands working in sub-agent context

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current AI/ML QA implementation
  - [ ] Document all AI/ML features and their dependencies
