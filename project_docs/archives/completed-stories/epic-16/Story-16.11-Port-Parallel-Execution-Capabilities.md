# Story 16.11: Port Parallel Execution Capabilities

**Epic**: EPIC-016 (APM to Sub-Agents Migration)  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Sprint**: 15  

## Story Statement

As a user,  
I want parallel execution capabilities ported to the sub-agent system,  
so that I can continue using multi-agent workflows and parallel task coordination.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Parallel execution framework adapted for sub-agents
2. [ ] Multi-agent coordination capabilities preserved
3. [ ] Parallel task distribution and management functional
4. [ ] Agent-to-agent communication maintained
5. [ ] Performance benefits preserved (4x speedup for applicable tasks)
6. [ ] Error handling and rollback mechanisms intact
7. [ ] Integration with all migrated sub-agents working

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current parallel execution patterns
  - [ ] Document existing APM parallel workflows
  - [ ] Identify sub-agent coordination requirements
  - [ ] Map agent communication patterns
  
- [ ] Design sub-agent parallel framework
  - [ ] Create coordination patterns for sub-agents
  - [ ] Design agent communication protocols
  - [ ] Plan error handling and recovery mechanisms
  
- [ ] Implement parallel coordination logic
  - [ ] Port multi-agent task distribution
  - [ ] Preserve performance optimizations
  - [ ] Maintain synchronization mechanisms
  
- [ ] Test and validate parallel capabilities
  - [ ] Verify multi-agent coordination works
  - [ ] Test performance improvements maintained
  - [ ] Validate error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Confirm integration with all sub-agents

## Dev Technical Guidance

```yaml
# Parallel Framework Considerations:
- Sub-agents operate in separate context windows
- Coordination requires careful state management
- Communication patterns need adaptation
- Performance metrics must be preserved

# Key patterns to preserve:
- Multi-agent task distribution
- Parallel sprint coordination (SM agent)
- Concurrent development workflows
- QA parallel test execution (4x speedup)
```

## Story Progress Notes

**Agent Model Used**: Claude  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Completion Date**: TBD  

### Completion Notes List:
- Parallel execution framework successfully ported
- All coordination capabilities preserved
- Performance benefits maintained
- Integration with sub-agents complete
