# Story 16.14: Implement Parallel Sprint Coordination

**Epic**: EPIC-016 (APM to Sub-Agents Migration)  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: 16  

## Story Statement

As a Scrum Master,  
I want parallel sprint coordination capabilities preserved in the sub-agent system,  
so that I can coordinate 2-4 Developer agents simultaneously with 60-80% sprint acceleration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Parallel sprint coordination functionality fully ported
2. [ ] Ability to launch 2-4 Developer sub-agents simultaneously
3. [ ] Real-time dependency management and coordination preserved
4. [ ] Integration point coordination capabilities maintained
5. [ ] Sprint acceleration benefits preserved (60-80% improvement)
6. [ ] Conflict prevention between parallel streams functional
7. [ ] Progress synthesis from multiple agents working
8. [ ] `/parallel-sprint` command functional in sub-agent context

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current parallel sprint implementation
  - [ ] Document multi-developer coordination patterns
  - [ ] Identify dependency management mechanisms
  - [ ] Map integration point coordination logic
  
- [ ] Design sub-agent parallel sprint architecture
  - [ ] Create multi-agent coordination framework
  - [ ] Design communication protocols between Developer sub-agents
  - [ ] Plan dependency resolution mechanisms
  
- [ ] Implement parallel coordination logic
  - [ ] Port multi-developer launch capabilities
  - [ ] Preserve real-time dependency management
  - [ ] Maintain conflict prevention algorithms
  - [ ] Implement progress synthesis mechanisms
  
- [ ] Test and validate parallel sprint capabilities
  - [ ] Test launching multiple Developer sub-agents
  - [ ] Verify dependency coordination works
  - [ ] Validate sprint acceleration benefits
  - [ ] Confirm integration success rate (>95% target)

## Dev Technical Guidance

```yaml
# Parallel Sprint Coordination Features:

# Multi-Agent Launch
- Coordinate 2-4 Developer sub-agents simultaneously
- Each agent works on different sprint stories
- Real-time progress tracking and synthesis

# Dependency Management
- Intelligent conflict prevention
- Integration point coordination
- Cross-story dependency resolution

# Performance Targets
- 60-80% sprint completion time reduction
- >95% successful integration rate
- Maintained code quality despite acceleration

# Revolutionary Capability
- ACTUAL Developer agents working simultaneously
- Not simulations - real parallel development
- Scrum Master coordinates integration and dependencies
```
