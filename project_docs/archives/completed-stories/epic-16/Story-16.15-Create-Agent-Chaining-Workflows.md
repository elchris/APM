# Story 16.15: Create Agent Chaining Workflows

**Epic**: EPIC-016 (APM to Sub-Agents Migration)  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Sprint**: 16  

## Story Statement

As a user,  
I want to create sophisticated agent chaining workflows in the sub-agent system,  
so that I can orchestrate complex multi-step processes across different specialized agents.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Agent chaining framework implemented for sub-agents
2. [ ] Workflow definition system created
3. [ ] Context passing between chained agents functional
4. [ ] Error handling and rollback mechanisms in place
5. [ ] Pre-defined workflow templates available
6. [ ] Custom workflow creation capabilities provided
7. [ ] Integration with all migrated sub-agents working

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Design agent chaining architecture
  - [ ] Create workflow definition schema
  - [ ] Design context passing mechanisms
  - [ ] Plan error handling and recovery patterns
  
- [ ] Implement chaining framework
  - [ ] Create workflow execution engine
  - [ ] Implement context persistence between agents
  - [ ] Build error handling and rollback capabilities
  
- [ ] Create workflow templates
  - [ ] Design common workflow patterns (Analyst → Architect → Developer)
  - [ ] Create QA validation workflows
  - [ ] Build project management workflows
  
- [ ] Test and validate chaining capabilities
  - [ ] Test basic agent-to-agent workflows
  - [ ] Verify context passing works correctly
  - [ ] Validate error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Confirm template workflows functional

## Dev Technical Guidance

```yaml
# Agent Chaining Patterns:

# Common Workflows:
- Requirements Gathering: Analyst → PO → Architect → Developer
- Quality Assurance: Developer → QA → SM (review)
- Feature Development: PO → Architect → Developer → QA

# Context Passing:
- Structured data exchange between agents
- Session state preservation
- Work artifact handoffs

# Error Handling:
- Rollback to previous agent in chain
- Error reporting and recovery
- Alternative workflow paths
```
