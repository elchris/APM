# Story 17.17: Deprecate Task-Based System

**Story ID**: 17.17  
**Epic**: Epic 17 - Parallel Commands to Native Sub-Agents Migration  
**Sprint**: 21 - Enhancement Phase  
**Points**: 2  
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: Stories 17.1-17.16

## Story Description

As a maintainer, I want to officially deprecate the Task-based parallel execution system so that we can focus development on the native sub-agent system and guide users to the superior solution.

## Business Value

Deprecating the old system reduces maintenance burden, clarifies the recommended approach, and ensures users adopt the native sub-agent system with its 4-8x performance benefits.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Deprecation Notices ✓
**Given** Task-based parallel commands  
**When** users execute them  
**Then** display:
- [ ] Clear deprecation warning
- [ ] Migration recommendation
- [ ] Performance comparison
- [ ] Timeline for removal
- [ ] Help resources link

### 2. Documentation Updates ✓
**Given** existing Task-based documentation  
**When** updating for deprecation  
**Then** mark:
- [ ] All Task examples as deprecated
- [ ] Add migration notes to each section
- [ ] Update best practices
- [ ] Remove from tutorials
- [ ] Archive old patterns

### 3. Code Cleanup ✓
**Given** Task-based implementation code  
**When** deprecating the system  
**Then** perform:
- [ ] Add deprecation decorators
- [ ] Update code comments
- [ ] Remove from new examples
- [ ] Plan removal timeline
- [ ] Archive for reference

### 4. User Communication ✓
**Given** active user base  
**When** announcing deprecation  
**Then** communicate via:
- [ ] Release notes announcement
- [ ] Email notification
- [ ] In-app messages
- [ ] Community forums
- [ ] Documentation banner

### 5. Sunset Planning ✓
**Given** deprecation timeline  
**When** planning removal  
**Then** establish:
- [ ] 6-month deprecation period
- [ ] 3-month warning period
- [ ] Final removal date
- [ ] Support transition plan
- [ ] Archive strategy

## Technical Design

### Deprecation Warning Format
```markdown
⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING
═════════════════════

The Task-based execution for /parallel-sprint is deprecated.

RECOMMENDED: Use native sub-agents (4.5x faster)
$ /parallel-sprint

To use deprecated mode (not recommended):
$ /parallel-sprint --mode=task --acknowledge-deprecation

This feature will be removed in v4.0.0 (January 2026)
Learn more: docs.apm-framework.com/deprecation/task-based
```

### Code Deprecation Pattern
```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Since v3.1.0 - Use native sub-agents instead
 * @removal v4.0.0 (January 2026)
 * @see https://docs.apm-framework.com/migration
 */
function executeTaskBasedParallel(command: string) {
  console.warn(DEPRECATION_MESSAGE);
  
  if (!options.acknowledgeDeprecation) {
    console.log("Add --acknowledge-deprecation to proceed");
    console.log("Better: Remove --mode=task for 4x speedup");
    return;
  }
  
  // Legacy implementation...
}
```

### Documentation Banner
```markdown
> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This page documents the deprecated Task-based 
> parallel execution system. For new development, use 
> [Native Sub-Agents](/docs/native-agents) which provide 4-8x 
> better performance. Task-based execution will be removed in v4.0.0.

### User Notification Email
```markdown
Subject: Important: APM Task-Based Commands Deprecation

Dear APM User,

We're excited to announce that native sub-agents now deliver 
4-8x performance improvements for all parallel commands!

**Action Required**: Migrate to native sub-agents by January 2026

**What's Changing**:
- Task-based parallel execution is deprecated
- Native sub-agents are now the default
- 4-8x faster execution guaranteed

**What You Need to Do**:
1. Remove "--mode=task" from your commands
2. Test your workflows (they'll be 4x faster!)
3. Run migration validator: /migrate-command validate

**Timeline**:
- Now: Deprecation warnings active
- Nov 2025: Final warning period
- Jan 2026: Task-based system removed

Thank you for using APM!

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add Deprecation Warnings** - Clear user notifications
2. **Update Documentation** - Mark all Task content
3. **Communicate Timeline** - Multi-channel announcement
4. **Monitor Migration** - Track adoption rates
5. **Execute Removal** - Clean removal in v4.0.0

## Success Metrics

- Migration rate >95% before removal
- Support tickets <20 about deprecation
- Clear understanding of timeline
- Smooth transition for all users
- No breaking surprises

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| User resistance | Low | Show performance benefits |
| Breaking workflows | Medium | 6-month transition period |
| Missing edge cases | Low | Comprehensive testing |

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Deprecation warnings implemented
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Communication sent
- [x] Timeline published
- [x] Removal plan documented
