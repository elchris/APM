# Sprint Archive

This directory contains archived sprint documentation for completed sprints.

## Purpose

When a sprint is completed, the Scrum Master moves the sprint details here for historical reference and metrics tracking.

## File Format

Archived sprints follow the naming convention:
```
Sprint-[ID]-Completed.md
```

Example: `Sprint-1-Completed.md`

## Archive Contents

Each archived sprint file contains:
- Sprint goals and objectives
- Stories completed with actual vs estimated points
- Sprint metrics (velocity, duration, etc.)
- Retrospective notes
- Lessons learned

## Time Tracking

Starting with Sprint 2, all archived sprints will include:
- Sprint start timestamp
- Sprint end timestamp
- Total sprint duration
- Individual task durations
- Work session tracking

## Usage

1. **Scrum Master**: Archives sprints upon completion
2. **Product Owner**: Reviews for velocity trends
3. **All Agents**: Reference for historical context
