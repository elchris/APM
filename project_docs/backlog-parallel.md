# Claude.md Merge System - PARALLEL EXECUTION BACKLOG

### Last Updated: 2025-01-20
### Product Owner: AP Orchestrator (Parallel Coordination Mode)
### Version: 2.0 - Parallel Execution Model

---

## ðŸš€ PARALLEL WORK STREAMS ORGANIZATION

### Product Vision
Create an intelligent merge system through parallel development streams, maximizing velocity by having multiple agents work concurrently on independent components.

### Parallel Execution Strategy
**3 Primary Work Streams + 1 Integration Stream**
- Each stream can be executed by independent developer agents
- Streams converge at integration points
- QA agents work in parallel with development

## ðŸ“Š PARALLEL EXECUTION TIMELINE

### Day 1-2: Maximum Parallelization
**Active Agents:**
- Dev-1 + QA-1: Stream A (Parsing) - 13 points
- Dev-2 + QA-2: Stream B (Backup) - 9 points  
- Dev-3: Stream C Phase 0 (Variable Engine) - 3 points
- Dev-4: Stream D (UX Design) - 3 points
- **Total Parallel Points:** 28 points

### Day 3-4: Merge Engine Focus
**Active Agents:**
- Dev-3 + Dev-1 + QA-3: Stream C Phase 1 & 2 - 23 points
- Dev-4: Integration prep work
- QA-1 & QA-2: Comprehensive testing of completed streams

### Day 5: Integration & Polish
**Active Agents:**
- Dev-4 + Architect: Integration completion - 10 points
- All QA agents: Full system validation
- Dev-1,2,3: Performance optimization - 8 points

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL PATH OPTIMIZATION

### Immediate Start (No Dependencies):
1. **Template Structure Analysis** (1.1) - Dev-1
2. **Section Parser** (1.2) - Dev-1  
3. **Backup System** (1.3) - Dev-2
4. **Variable Engine** (2.2) - Dev-3
5. **UX Design** (4.3) - Dev-4
6. **Test Framework** (5.1) - Dev-2
7. **Core Utilities** (1.4) - Dev-1

**7 Stories = 22 points can start IMMEDIATELY with zero dependencies**

### Dependency Management:
- Stream A output (parsers) unblocks Stream C Phase 1
- Stream C Phase 1 output unblocks Stream D integration
- All streams feed into final integration

---

## ðŸš¦ PARALLEL QA STRATEGY

### Continuous Validation Model:
- **QA-1**: Tests parsing accuracy as Dev-1 completes components
- **QA-2**: Validates backup/restore scenarios in parallel
- **QA-3**: Creates merge test cases while engine develops
- **QA-Lead**: Orchestrates comprehensive system tests

### Test Execution Phases:
1. **Unit Testing**: Each QA tests their stream components
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-stream validation  
3. **System Testing**: Full workflow validation
4. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing

---

## ðŸ“ˆ VELOCITY AMPLIFICATION

### Traditional Sequential: ~14 points per 2-day sprint
### Parallel Execution: ~28 points per 2-day burst

**2X VELOCITY INCREASE through parallel agent coordination**

### Resource Allocation:
- 4 Developer Agents (specialized)
- 3 QA Agents + 1 QA Lead
- 1 Architect (design review)
- 1 Product Owner (coordination)

---

## ðŸ”„ COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Daily Sync Points:
1. **Morning**: PO assigns stories to agents
2. **Midday**: Cross-stream dependency check
3. **Evening**: Integration readiness review

### Conflict Resolution:
- Architect reviews design conflicts
- PO prioritizes resource allocation
- SM facilitates cross-team blockers

---

## ðŸŽª BENEFITS OF PARALLEL APPROACH

1. **Faster Delivery**: 5 days instead of 10
2. **Reduced Blocking**: Multiple paths forward
3. **Specialized Focus**: Agents become domain experts
4. **Continuous Testing**: QA in parallel, not sequential
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Issues found earlier
6. **Flexibility**: Can reassign agents as needed
