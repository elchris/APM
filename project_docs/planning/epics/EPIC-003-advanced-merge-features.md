## Risks & Mitigations

### Deprecated Section Identification
**Risk**: Incorrect identification may remove valid user content  
**Mitigation**: Conservative identification with user confirmation, comprehensive backup before removal

### Validation Complexity
**Risk**: Complex validation may introduce performance bottlenecks  
**Mitigation**: Tiered validation approach, performance benchmarking, configurable validation levels

### Migration Accuracy
**Risk**: Legacy content migration may fail or corrupt data  
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing with legacy formats, validation of migration results, rollback capabilities

- Legacy formats are well-documented and stable
- Users prefer conservative approaches to advanced features
- Performance impact of advanced features is acceptable

### Out of Scope
- Advanced AI-based content analysis
- Real-time validation during editing
- Integration with external validation tools
- Complex migration workflows requiring user interaction

### Future Considerations
