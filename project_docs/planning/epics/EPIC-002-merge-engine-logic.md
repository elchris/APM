## Risks & Mitigations

### Complex Section Merging
**Risk**: Edge cases in section merging may cause data loss or corruption  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite with edge cases, backup-first approach, and validation

### Variable Substitution Accuracy
**Risk**: Incorrect variable substitution may break user configurations  
**Mitigation**: Careful pattern matching, validation of results, and preservation of original values

### Merge Conflict Resolution
**Risk**: Automatic conflict resolution may make incorrect decisions  
**Mitigation**: Conservative approach with user notification, manual override options, and audit logging

### Performance with Large Files

## Notes

### Open Questions
- Should merge conflicts require user approval or attempt automatic resolution?
- What level of fuzzy matching should be used for section classification?
- Should the system support rollback of merge operations?

### Assumptions
- User customizations are primarily in specific sections
- Template updates follow consistent patterns
- Merge conflicts will be relatively rare in normal usage
- Performance requirements are for typical file sizes (< 100KB)

### Out of Scope
- Real-time merge preview during editing
- Advanced machine learning for classification
- Integration with external merge tools
- Graphical conflict resolution interface

### Future Considerations
- Machine learning-based classification improvement
- Integration with version control systems
- Advanced merge strategies (three-way merge, etc.)
- Performance optimization for very large files
