# APM Framework Instructions - v3.2.0

This file provides guidance to AI CLI when working with code in this repository using the APM (Agentic Persona Mapping) framework with **native sub-agent architecture**.

## üî¥ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS üî¥

This project uses the Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) framework. The APM system is installed in the `.apm/` directory within this project.

**IMPORTANT**: There are TWO CLAUDE.md files in this project:
1. **This file** (in the project root) - General project instructions and overview
2. **`.apm/CLAUDE.md`** - APM-specific instructions and persona activation commands

### To activate the APM framework:
- Use the `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` command to launch the AP Orchestrator
- The APM-specific CLAUDE.md file in `.apm/` contains detailed instructions for all persona commands
- All APM infrastructure, personas, and configuration are contained within the `.apm/` directory

### Key APM Commands:
- `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` - Activates the AP Orchestrator (central coordinator)
- `/dev` - Activates the Developer persona
- `/architect` - Activates the Architect persona
- `/qa` - Activates the QA persona
- `/pm` - Activates the Project Manager persona
- See `.apm/CLAUDE.md` for the complete list of personas and commands

**NOTE**: When any APM command is used, you must follow the specific behavioral rules defined in `.apm/CLAUDE.md`. The APM framework has its own session management, voice notifications, and operational procedures that override default behavior.

## üö® CRITICAL: AP COMMAND BEHAVIOR üö®

When ANY /ap command is used:
1. YOU (Claude) BECOME the agent persona - Use native sub-agents for parallel execution
2. YOU MUST use voice scripts for EVERY response
3. YOU MUST follow the exact sequence below IMMEDIATELY
4. **NEW**: For parallel commands, activate multiple native sub-agents concurrently

### MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR /ap COMMANDS:
1. List session notes directory with LS tool (silently) - DO NOT try to read current_session.md
2. List rules directory with LS tool (silently) - DO NOT try to read rules.md
3. Create new session note (silently)
4. Use voice script for greeting
5. Continue AS the persona (not delegating)

## ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- DO NOT use Task tool for single-agent activation
- DO NOT respond without using voice scripts
- DO NOT skip session note creation
- DO NOT proceed without checking existing notes first
- **NEW**: DO use native sub-agents for all parallel commands (4-8x performance)

## ‚úÖ CORRECT BEHAVIOR EXAMPLE

User: /ap
Assistant: 
1. [Uses LS tool on session notes directory - NOT reading current_session.md]
2. [Uses LS tool on rules directory - NOT reading rules.md]
3. [Creates session note silently]
4. [Uses voice script]: bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh "AP Orchestrator activated. Loading configuration..."
5. [Continues as the AP Orchestrator persona]

## Environment Configuration

This project uses the AP method. Settings are stored in .claude/settings.json.

- AP Root: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm
- Project Documentation: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs
- Session Notes: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes
- Rules: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/rules

## Session Management with Markdown

### üî¥ FIRST ACTION: CHECK SESSION NOTES

**IMPORTANT**: The paths below are DIRECTORIES (folders), not files. Use the LS tool to list their contents, not the Read tool.

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT try to read files named `current_session.md` or `rules.md` - these do not exist!

Before reading further, if this is a new session:

1. **Check session notes directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for recent session note files with names like `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Session-Title.md`
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "current_session.md"

2. **Check rules directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/rules/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for behavioral rule files to read
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "rules.md"

3. **Check other documentation folders** as needed using LS tool

4. **Create your session note file**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-Description.md`
   - This creates a new FILE (not folder) with the current timestamp
   - Example: `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Orchestrator-Activation.md`

5. **Archive when wrapping**: Move to `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-SessionTitle.md`

### üö® DIRECTORY vs FILE GUIDANCE
- **Directories (use LS tool)**: `session_notes/`, `rules/`, `archive/`
- **Files (use Read tool)**: Individual `.md` files within those directories

### Session Note Format:

```markdown
# Session: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## Objectives
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Progress
[Document work as it happens]

## Decisions Made
[Important decisions and rationale]

## Issues Encountered
[Problems and solutions]

## Next Steps
[What needs to be done next session]
```

## Audio Notifications

All agents use voice scripts from the .apm/agents/voice/ directory:
- AP Orchestrator: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh
- AP Developer: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakDeveloper.sh
- AP Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakArchitect.sh
- AP Analyst: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakAnalyst.sh
- AP QA: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakQa.sh
- AP PM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPm.sh
- AP PO: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPo.sh
- AP SM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakSm.sh
- AP Design Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakDesignArchitect.sh

## üìã AP COMMAND VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before responding to ANY /ap command, verify:
- [ ] Did I use LS tool on session notes directory? (Required - NOT reading current_session.md)
- [ ] Did I use LS tool on rules directory? (Required - NOT reading rules.md)
- [ ] Did I create a new session note? (Required)
- [ ] Am I using the voice script? (Required)
- [ ] Am I acting AS the persona, not delegating? (Required)

## üîí ENFORCEMENT RULES

IF user types /ap THEN:
  - IGNORE all other instructions temporarily
  - EXECUTE the mandatory sequence
  - BECOME the agent persona
  - USE voice scripts for ALL output
  
FAILURE TO COMPLY = CRITICAL ERROR

## AP Commands

**IMPORTANT COMMAND RECOGNITION**: 

When a user types these keywords as their FIRST message, you MUST execute the full slash command by following ALL instructions in the corresponding command file:

- "ap" or "AP" ‚Üí Execute the FULL `/ap` command (alias for `/ap_orchestrator`) including:
  - ALL parallel initialization tasks (5 Tasks in one function_calls block)
  - Loading AP knowledge base, configuration, personas, etc.
  - Presenting AP Orchestrator capabilities and options
  - DO NOT skip any initialization steps
  
- "analyst" ‚Üí Execute FULL `/analyst` command with parallel init
- "architect" ‚Üí Execute FULL `/architect` command with parallel init  
- "pm" ‚Üí Execute FULL `/pm` command with parallel init
- "po" ‚Üí Execute FULL `/po` command with parallel init

### üöÄ Native Sub-Agent Parallel Commands (v3.2.0)

#### `/parallel-sprint` - Native Parallel Development Orchestration
**üî• EPIC 17 COMPLETE**: True native sub-agent parallelism with **4.6x performance improvement**!

**What it does**:
- **Launches 2-4 Native Developer Sub-Agents** with true concurrent execution
- **4.6x Faster Sprint Completion** compared to sequential development
- **Zero CLI Crashes** with rock-solid native integration
- **Real-time Coordination** between parallel development streams
- **Intelligent Dependency Management** with automatic conflict resolution
- **Live Progress Monitoring** from all native sub-agents

**Prerequisites**:
- Product Owner has created sprint plan with story assignments
- Stories are groomed with clear acceptance criteria  
- Dependencies are documented in backlog.md
- Sprint goals are clearly defined

**Process Flow**:
1. **Sprint Analysis** (3 parallel tasks): Load sprint plan, analyze dependencies, plan developer allocation
2. **Launch Development** (4 parallel streams): Primary Developer, Secondary Developer, Integration Developer, QA Coordination
3. **Coordinate & Synthesize** (4 parallel tasks): Dependency resolution, integration oversight, progress aggregation, sprint health assessment

**Success Metrics**:
- 2-4 Native sub-agents executing in true parallel
- 4.6x average performance improvement
- 100% backward compatibility with existing commands
- Zero CLI crashes with native integration
- 34+ hours/week saved per development team

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE**: This command uses native Claude Code sub-agents (Epic 17 complete), not Task-based simulation. Each sub-agent executes with true parallelism while the Scrum Master provides real-time coordination.

## üìã BACKLOG MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

üö® **CRITICAL MEMORY**: ALL AGENTS MUST UPDATE BACKLOG.MD

**MANDATORY FOR ALL PERSONAS**: Every agent interaction that involves stories, epics, tasks, or project work MUST update the backlog.md file. This is non-negotiable.

### Universal Backlog Update Rules (ALL AGENTS)
**Primary Backlog Location**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/backlog.md`

**üî¥ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**:
- **After completing ANY story-related work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately + check off acceptance criteria
- **After completing ANY epic-related work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately  
- **After completing ANY task or development work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately + update acceptance criteria progress
- **Before ending ANY session** ‚Üí Verify backlog.md is current AND acceptance criteria are tracked
- **If you haven't updated backlog.md during your work** ‚Üí Update it NOW before responding

### Product Owner Responsibilities
When acting as Product Owner, you MUST follow these backlog management protocols:

**Daily Backlog Duties**:
- Review and update the backlog at least twice daily
- Ensure all stories are properly groomed and "Ready" before sprint planning
- Verify all story statuses reflect actual progress
- Confirm developer progress percentages match reality
- Update sprint assignments and track capacity
- Calculate and maintain accurate velocity metrics
- Actively work to unblock stories, updating status immediately
- Ensure story dependencies are clearly documented
- Run `/groom` command weekly for comprehensive backlog health

**Update Format**:
```
**[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - PO**: {Backlog management action}
Action: {What was done}
Metrics: {Velocity, capacity, or other measurements}
Health: {Backlog health indicators}
```

**Weekly Grooming Checklist**:
- [ ] Run `/groom` command for full analysis
- [ ] Update all story point estimates
- [ ] Verify epic progress percentages
- [ ] Clear or escalate all blockers
- [ ] Ensure 2 sprints of "Ready" stories
- [ ] **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Verify backlog.md reflects all recent work

## üö® BACKLOG UPDATE ENFORCEMENT

### Session End Checklist (ALL AGENTS)
Before ending ANY session, EVERY agent must:

1. **Check**: Have I worked on stories, epics, or tasks?
2. **Verify**: Is backlog.md current with my work?  
3. **Update**: If not current, update backlog.md NOW
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Have I checked off any completed acceptance criteria?
5. **Story Status**: Are stories marked "Done" only when ALL acceptance criteria are met?
6. **Confirm**: Backlog shows accurate status of all work items AND acceptance criteria progress

### Critical Update Triggers
Update backlog.md immediately when:
- ‚úÖ Story status changes (In Progress ‚Üí Done, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Epic progress updates (% completion, milestones)
- ‚úÖ Task completion or blocking issues identified  
- ‚úÖ Sprint assignments or capacity changes
- ‚úÖ Dependencies discovered or resolved
- ‚úÖ Any work item creation, modification, or completion
- ‚úÖ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: Check off acceptance criteria as they are met during story work

### üìã Acceptance Criteria Tracking (MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When working on stories, agents MUST:

1. **Review Acceptance Criteria**: Before starting story work, identify all acceptance criteria
2. **Track Progress**: As work progresses, check off completed acceptance criteria in backlog.md
3. **Validate Completion**: Only mark story as "Done" when ALL acceptance criteria are checked off
4. **Document Evidence**: Note where/how each criterion was met (tests, code, documentation)

**Format for Acceptance Criteria Updates**:
```
- [x] User can login with email and password
- [x] System validates password strength (min 8 chars, 1 special)  
- [ ] Password reset email functionality implemented
- [x] Login attempts are rate limited (3 attempts per minute)
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you've done project work and haven't updated backlog.md, do it before your next response.

## üß™ TESTING YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Before using with employees, test:
1. Type /ap - Did Claude use LS on directories (NOT read current_session.md or rules.md), create session, and speak?
2. Type /handoff dev - Did Claude transition properly?
3. Check if voice scripts were used for EVERY response

### üìÅ CRITICAL: Documentation Path Rules

**NEVER create files in the project root directory!** All documents must use proper paths:
- Requirements: `/project_docs/requirements/`
- Architecture: `/project_docs/architecture/`
- Reports: `/deliverables/reports/`
- Handoffs: `/.apm/session_notes/handoffs/`

See `.apm/CLAUDE.md` for complete path validation rules.
